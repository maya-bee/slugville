## What is motivation?

Google says that motivation is "the general desire or willingness of someone to do something." It's a great definition, but what exactly is being said here? Let's start with the "willingness" piece.

I have a personal project involving coding that I've been working on. I can't say any details yet, since I'm not sure if it's going to pan out. The problem I'm running into is that I have no motivation to work on it. That's not to say I don't *want* to work on it, I just have no willingness to. I am not prepared nor am I ready.

Despite having the desire to work on it and see it complete, I don't want to put any hours into it. I'd rather rot away, twiddling at my thumbs as I stare off into space, wondering where it all went wrong.

Paradoxically though, I make progress. I'll get out of bed, sit down, and chip away at it. Why is that? I don't want to, I don't feel like it, I'd rather not, but I do it anyway.

Is this motivation? I have a "general desire" to have it completed, but I still don't want to get to work.

## The desire piece

Desire. Do I even have a desire to see it completed? I feel like Sisyphus pushing his boulder, up and up aimlessly over an insurmountable mountain, just to watch it roll back down again. I think I get motivated, I gather the strength to start working on it, then the weight on my shoulders starts crushing me until I give in and go back to bed.

I do have a desire, though. There's the piece of me begging me to get out of bed, though there's also the piece of me that is exhausted and wanting to go home. The issue is that the exhaustion never goes away, and if I listen to that piece, I only get more exhausted.

## Motivation's role

The role of motivation is to convince ourselves we should do something. It's a loud voice that moves us to complete things. We're so trained to wait for motivation to come that when it doesn't, we're stuck. We feel useless without it, ever-dependant on that touch of stimulus.

Something that took me a long time to realize is that I don't need to be convinced. I don't need something telling me what to do or when to do it. I will do it, because I must see it done.

## My distraction

Motivation is not necessary. I don't need it, though it sure as hell takes the edge off of things. Why should I sit around and wait for it?

For a lot of people, motivation is the guiding light in the dark. But for me, for a person who is forever burnt out and exhausted, it's a distraction from what I need to do. It's an unreliable force that never comes around, something that will abandon you when you most need it.

To me, motivation is a broken promise. So, to answer my question from the beginning, it's not motivation that keeps me coming back to my project. It's my own passion.
