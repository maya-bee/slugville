# What is Slugville?

Imagine you're taking a hike in the woods. It's early in the morning, and you can feel the dew of the tall grass as it brushes up against your legs. The stress of work has been crushing you lately. You need a way to take your mind off of it, even if only for a moment.

This morning is particularly chill and foggy. You make sure to follow the rocky trail closely, lest you get lost. As you walk, you take in the soothing atmosphere. The smell of the trees clears your clouded mind. The chirps and whistles of the birds high above remind you of simpler times. You feel grounded in nature - you know it's somewhere you'll always belong.

Eventually you meet an inviting, wooden bench. You've been walking for a while now with no place to rest. The bench is damp from the drizzle of the night prior, but you don't mind. You sit down and look up at the sky. It's a rich and enchanting dark blue, right before the sunrise. The moon shines alone valiantly, its unmatched brilliance unmasked by any clouds. Away from the light pollution of the city, you can see clearly all of what you're missing.

You wish you could run away. You wish you could leave your old life and live happily in a small cabin in the woods. You don't want to be just another cog in the machine, but it's inescapable. You wish you could just make peace with how your life is, but it feels like you could never achieve your aspirations.

As the sun rises, you know it's time to go. With a deep sigh, you get up and continue walking along the winding trail, with no end in sight...

Anyway, Slugville is my blog where I post meaningless nonsense about video games.
